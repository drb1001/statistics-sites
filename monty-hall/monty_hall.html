<!-- end of first game: Do you think it is better to stick or switch (or doesn't it matter)? PLay a few times and find out -->
<!-- after 10 games: you can simulate many games if you want to speed things up (play 10 games with a click - get them to select strategy) -->
<!-- How to solve this:
In your initial choice, you pick goats 2/3 of the time, and car 1/3 of the time.
If you pick the car with your initial choice, you should choose to stick.
If you pick a goat with your intitial choice, you should choose to switch to the car.
This means 2/3 of the time you should switch, 1/3 you should stick, so overall it's better to stick.
